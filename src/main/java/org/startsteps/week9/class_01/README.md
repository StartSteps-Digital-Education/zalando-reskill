# Day 1: Java Map and Set Integration
**Project Title**: Employee Management and Reporting System

**Project Description**:
On the first day, we'll start with the Employee Management System, emphasizing Java Map and Set to store and manage employee data, while incorporating OOP and Collections.

**Tasks**:
- 
- Create an Employee class with attributes like name, ID, department, job title, and manager ID. Apply encapsulation and use getter and setter methods.
- Implement a HashSet to store unique employees. Utilize proper data structures and ensure efficient searching.
- Implement a HashMap to store employees with their IDs as keys. Encapsulate access to the map and provide methods for CRUD operations.
- Implement methods to add, remove, and search for employees by ID, using OOP principles to structure the code.
- Implement methods to filter and display employees by department, job title, or manager, taking advantage of Java Collections for filtering.
- Implement methods to update employee information while maintaining data integrity.
- Implement basic reporting functionality to display employee statistics (e.g., total employees, employees per department) using Java Map and Set.
- Add error handling with custom exceptions for scenarios like duplicate employee IDs or invalid inputs.
