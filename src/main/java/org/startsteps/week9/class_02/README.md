# Day 2: Graphs and Tree Integration

**Project Description**:
On the second day, we'll build upon the existing Employee Management System to represent the organization hierarchy using a tree structure (e.g., binary tree), while incorporating OOP and Collections.

**Tasks**:
-
- Extend the Employee class to include more information, such as hire date and salary, and create constructors with appropriate parameters.
- Create a tree structure (e.g., binary tree) to represent the organization hierarchy based on manager-subordinate relationships, employing OOP principles for node design.
- Implement methods to add employees to the hierarchy and establish parent-child relationships while maintaining the tree's integrity.
- Implement methods to find the lowest common manager of two employees, utilizing OOP for tree traversal.
- Display the organization hierarchy with proper indentation, emphasizing the use of Collections for proper ordering and structure.
- Enhance the reporting functionality to include hierarchical reports (e.g., reporting to a specific manager), encapsulating tree operations.
- Add additional features such as finding the highest-paid employee or the employee with the longest tenure, making use of Collections for efficient data retrieval.
- Include error handling for hierarchical operations, ensuring that the tree remains consistent.
