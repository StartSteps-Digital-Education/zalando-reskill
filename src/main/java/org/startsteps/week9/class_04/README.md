# Day 3: Java Enums and Reflection Integration

**Project Description**:
On the third day, we'll integrate Java Enums and Reflection into the Employee Management and Reporting System to allow dynamic generation of reports, while incorporating OOP and Collections.

**Tasks**:
-
- Create an Enum to define different report types (e.g., employee, department, hierarchy), encapsulating report types as objects.
- Implement a class that uses Reflection to dynamically generate reports based on the selected report type, leveraging OOP design patterns.
- Allow the user to choose a report type (using the Enum) and generate the corresponding report, encapsulating report generation logic.
- Demonstrate how to use Enums and Reflection to access and manipulate class properties for report generation while adhering to OOP principles.
- Further enhance the reporting functionality to support multiple report types, including the previously implemented statistics and hierarchical reports.
- Implement the ability to export generated reports to a file (e.g., CSV or JSON) while considering OOP design for file handling.
- Add unit tests to ensure the correctness of the reporting functionality, following best practices for testing and encapsulating test cases.
