# Day 4: Java Serialization

1. Create a more complex class (e.g. **Student**) with additional attributes like address, GPA, a list of courses taken, and a list of hobbies. Implement serialization for this class.

2. Create multiple instances of the **Student** class, serialize them to the same file, and handle any potential conflicts.

3. Add error handling for serialization, especially for class/version mismatches.

4. Implement a feature that allows the user to update a student's GPA, courses taken, and hobbies in the program, serialize it, and display the updated information.

5. Create a backup of the serialized data for disaster recovery purposes.

6. Extend the Student class to include additional attributes like a list of courses taken (e.g., Math, Science) and their corresponding grades.
7. Implement serialization and deserialization for the updated Student class.
8. Add error handling for serialization and deserialization, including handling cases where the class structure has changed.
9. Create a function to display a list of all serialized student objects with their names and GPAs.
10. Implement a function that calculates and displays the average GPA of all serialized student objects.
